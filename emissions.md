The global shipping fleet is one of the biggest atmospheric polluters in the world: enormous engines that burn thick bunker fuel, emitting not only CO<sub>2</sub> but harmful sulfur gases.
Currently, there is not an effective alternative to internal combustion in the industry, but that does not mean that there is not room for improvement.
CoreMarine Insight provides the optimum handling parameters so that not one unnecessary drop of fuel is burned, and tracks the consumption of fuel through the route.
